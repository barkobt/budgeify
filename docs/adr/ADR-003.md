# ADR-003: PWA Icon Generation Pipeline

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Context:** manifest.json referenced icon-192.png and icon-512.png but these files did not exist. PWA install would fail silently.

**Decision:** Add `sharp` as devDependency. Create `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` to convert the existing `public/icon.svg` to required PNG sizes (32, 180, 192, 512). Update manifest with all icon entries including apple-touch-icon.

**Consequences:**
- PWA install works correctly
- Icons regenerable from single SVG source
- Consistent branding across all platforms
