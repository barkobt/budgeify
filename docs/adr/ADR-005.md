# ADR-005: Oracle AI — Hybrid Heuristics Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Context:** AI assistant was a static chatbot with 4 hardcoded responses. No real data analysis, no financial intelligence.

**Decision:** Build a hybrid heuristics engine:
- All financial calculations are deterministic (no LLM dependency)
- 5-factor health score, MoM trend analysis, anomaly detection, goal tracking
- Template-based Turkish text generation
- Optional LLM layer for future natural language enhancement (not activated)
- Confidence estimation per insight based on data availability
- localStorage memory for insight persistence

**Key Principle:** The LLM never generates numbers. All financial data comes from the heuristics engine. If no API key exists, the system works fully with templates.

**Consequences:**
- AI assistant provides real, actionable financial advice
- No hallucinated numbers
- Works offline (all computation is client-side)
- Easy to extend with LLM layer later
